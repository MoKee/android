MoKee Open Source
===========

Submitting Patches
------------------
Patches are always welcomed!  Please submit your patches via MoKee Gerrit! You can do this by using these commands:

    (From root android directory)
    . build/envsetup.sh
    (Go to repo you are patching, make your changes and commit)
    mkgerrit <for(new)/changes(patch set)> <branch/change-id>

    repo start mko .
    (Make your changes and commit)
    repo upload .
    or
    git push ssh://<username>@review.mfunz.com:29418/<project> HEAD:refs/for/<branch>

*Note: "." means current directory*

*Commit Example*

We want to make a change in InputDevice.java that resides in the frameworks/base project, and upload that to Gerrit for review. Let's start a local branch of that repo (directory) and call it mychanges:

    repo start mychanges frameworks/base && cd frameworks/base

Now we make our edits to that file. We can check those changes:

    git add InputDevice.java (or git add .)

Then commit it:

    git commit -m 'Added feature xyz'

Go to the root of your local android folder, and issue the upload:

    cd ~/mokee && repo upload frameworks/base

For more help on using repo, use this command:

    repo help upload

Make your changes and commit with a detailed message, starting with what you are working with (i.e. vision: Update Kernel).

Commit your patches in a single commit. Squash multiple commits using this command:

    git rebase -i HEAD~<# of commits>

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with MoKee Open Source, you will need to get
familiar with [Repo](https://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html) and [Version Control with Git](https://source.android.com/source/version-control.html).

To initialize your local repository using the MoKee trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u https://github.com/MoKee/android.git -b mko

Then to sync up:

    repo sync

Start Work
----------

To work faster, we introduced a new build script to help you start compiling.

First, go to the root path of your project. We assume that your source is under
(/mokee):

    cd /mokee

then feel free to use the build script:

    . build/envsetup.sh && lunch (enter device number) && mka bacon

or

    ./mk

The script is interactive so everything else is self-explanatory.
